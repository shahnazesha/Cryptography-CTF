# Cryptography-CTF
Cryptography CTF challenges are a popular way to test and enhance your skills in the field of cryptography. These challenges typically involve solving various cryptographic puzzles, ciphers, and codes to uncover hidden messages or passwords.
#Where it use
Encryption/Decryption: Ciphers and algorithms used to encode and decode messages.
Steganography: Hiding secret information within seemingly innocuous files or media.
Hash Functions: Verifying the integrity of data or storing passwords securely.
Digital Signatures: Authenticating the sender of a message and ensuring data integrity.
Secure Communication: Establishing secure channels for confidential communication (e.g., SSL/TLS).
Key Exchange: Securely exchanging encryption keys between parties.
Password Cracking: Breaking weak or poorly implemented passwords using various techniques.
Cryptanalysis: Analyzing cryptographic systems to find vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
Side-Channel Attacks: Exploiting unintended information leakage from a system (e.g., timing or power consumption).
Obfuscation: Hiding the true purpose or behavior of code to prevent reverse engineering.
